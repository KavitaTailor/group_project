    <h1>SDG Connect</h1>

    <p>Despite the progress that has been made towards achieving equal rights for both men and women, considerable work
      still remains to be done in the UK. SDG Connect aims to connect those that have suffered from causes of gender
      inequality to charities within the UK that are working to support those causes. Find out more about the work that we do here.</p>
